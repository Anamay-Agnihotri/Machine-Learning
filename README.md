# Machine Learning

### Denison University

Repository includes worksamples of machine learning techniques like k-means and knn along with their R implementation. Also included Jupyter notebooks for dynamic programming for edit distance problems, Naive-Bayes classifier, part of speech tagger (HMM) and bi-gram implementations in Python
#### Software/Tools needed: 

R/RStudio (ideally Version 1.0.143 and +)
Python 3
Make sure you install all the package requirements shown in the rmd (or .ipynb) file.

#### Repository contains:

Hieroglyphic clustering using K-means

Market-based prediction modelling for video-rental service data using k-nearest neighbours.

Sentiment analysis using Naive-Bayes classifier.

Hidden markov model (HMM) implementation using Viterbi algorithm for part of speech tagging.

Text perplexity calculator using bi-grams.

##### Note: This repository only contains select files for the mentioned topics due to the sensitive nature of the code/data. 

#### Authors include: 

##### Anamay Agnihotri, Dr. Anthony Bonifonte, Dr. Jessen Havill
